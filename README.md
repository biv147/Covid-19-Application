# Covid-19-Application

### Java, Android, JSON, SQLite, Google Maps API

This is an application that shows users the global statistics of Covid-19. 

This application also allows users to get statistics on specific countries as well. This can be done
either by selecting any country on the map or searching for it. Using JSON, the data for that specific country 
is returned and shown on screen. Finally the data retrieved can be stored in a database.
